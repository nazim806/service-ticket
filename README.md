# service-ticket

An online ticketing system streamlines how you communicate with your customers. Unlike email, it does not require

the set up of multiple folder structures and color coded tags to prioritize and track relevant customer queries. 

It brings in customer conversations from multiple channels like phone, email, and social media into a single, 

easily accessible location where you get all the context you need. A good helpdesk ticketing system also 

lets you automate routine support tasks to increase the efficiency of your team and reduce excessive workload.
